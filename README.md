# My_Learnings
I am planning to share my learning experiecnes in this repository

1. Persistance_Entrace.java -
  In this file I have shared the solution from my side to solve the resprctive question added in the comment of file which was asked by the 'Perststace' in my first Placement drive experience.
  I wanted to share that I was unable to solve this question at the time of examination and actually that thing motivated me to learn the coding. So, recently I have started learning the Java Programming language thorugh Apna College YT channel.
Here is the link of my teacher form Apna College Shradha Didi [@shradha-khapra](https://github.com/shradha-khapra)

2. numberConversions.java -
   Actually main reason to share this code is that I was stuck at the function binaryToDecimal() for last few days. Today, I checked some solutions and used the new learnings in my logic. After multiple trials I got the accurate code, so here it is.
   In this code I have written a code to convert binary number to decimal number and visa versa.
   I have wrriten three user defined functions named binaryToDecimal() , decimalToBinary() and powerOfTwo() for their respective working.
   New learning: to convert a 'char' variable to 'int' variable we do following,
   char c = '2';
   int x = c - '0';
   int y = x + 1;
   System.out.print(x+"\n"+y);

   Output:
   2
   3
