# My_Learnings
I am planning to share my learning experiecnes in this repository

1. Persistance_Entrace.java -
  In this file I have shared the solution from my side to solve the resprctive question added in the comment of file which was asked by the 'Perststace' in my first Placement drive experience.
  I wanted to share that I was unable to solve this question at the time of examination and actually that thing motivated me to learn the coding. So, recently I have started learning the Java Programming language thorugh Apna College YT channel.
Here is the link of my teacher form Apna College Shradha Didi [@shradha-khapra](https://github.com/shradha-khapra)
